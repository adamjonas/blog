## What is it?

  - beefed up view layer
  - one way data binding -> if state changes the view changes
  - creates a virtual DOM
  - doesn't provide any data management systems like backbone, Alt.js, Redux
  - no ajax, use JQuery
  - no routing capabilities
  - does not work well with JQuery DOM manipulation
  - can re-render a lot because of the virtual DOM manipulation

## Setup

  - Babel
  - Gulp - task runner like rake
  - Webpack - processes through Babel interpreter and make it useable code

## Quirks

  - class becomes className since it is a reserved word
  - typeSetting

## Going forwards

  - flux
    - alt.js
