### Random notes from code reading

- with 64-bit pointers

- poro -> an array, for example, is made multiple times. One with items
of the array, again for indexes of the array, etc.

- memory swap -> linked lists

- [red-black tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red%E2%80%93black_tree)

- [sparse array](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sparse_array)

- program restart re-allocates the memory
