## ODI Discussion/Analysis Questions

1)

- What characteristics of the ODI lens are likely to make it appealing/unappealing to farmers?
  - Appealing
    -  debeaking causes problems of their own in terms of the trauma it causes hurts short term production (for a full week, only 1 egg lost by 5 months) and in the long term in feed is wasted. Debeaking is not an exact science but reduced cannibalism to 9% from 25%.
      - for $2.50/hour could debeak approximately 220 birds per hour.
    - actually modifies behavior as opposed to reducing the weapon. Reduces cannibalsim to 4.5% (1/2 of debeaking)
      - 225 birds an hour to put in lense
    - reduces feed costs from 24.46 pounds to 23.68 lbs per 100 birds
      - 20,000 bird flock could save 156 pounds of feed per day ($12.324/day)
      - $158 per ton - $.079/lbs

  - unappealing
    - more upfront cost
    - can cause eye infection/fall out of place
    - change from current practice.

2)

- What is the value to famers of lenses over debeaking? Can you quantify it? (Hint: Think about savings from cannibalization, egg reduction, feed, and labor)
  - $.00073 a bird for the debeaking process (which would be unneccessary).
  - $.22 per bird feed savings over a hen's lifetime
  - $.108 in reduction in replacement cost of of $.21 since lenses reduces cannibolism by 1/2.
  - $.224 of added production in egg production. Hen lays 22 dozen eggs a year. If they lose a week of production from debeaking that is .423 dozen a week (which is 5 eggs a week) and if you assume that is $.53 a dozen that is $.224 cents of lost egg production per bird.

  - adds up to ~$.33 in added value per bird over their lifetime -> for large farms (50,000 birds) that $17,500 in added revenue a year (though it is annual cashflow of $12 million). For a small farm (10k) is it $3,500.


3)

- What Pricing policy should ODI adopt and why? What is the savings per bird for farmers at these prices?
  - need market acceptance
  - somewhere around $.35 per bird in added value, which would easily cover the $.07 price increase.

  - Skimming Price
    - For products that represent a drastic departure from accepted ways of performing a service, a policy of relatively high prices coupled with heavy promotional expenditures in the early stages of market development (and lower prices at later stages) has proved successful for many products.
  - Penetration pricing
    - This policy is the reverse of the skimming policy in which the price is lowered only as short-run competition forces it.

4)

- Can ODI turn a profit at these prices?
  - sell at $0.08 per pair
  - cost $0.032 per pair + 12k (for first 15 million pairs)
  - cost $592,000 to operate
  - .048 per pair  in profit
  - 592,000 / .048 = 12,333,333 lens to break even meaning they need .1% market penetration.

5)

- How would you focus ODI's marketing efforts? How would you segment the
customer base?
  - 345 farms have 20% of america's chickens. If they closed 4 of those farms they would be able to able to turn an operating profit.
    - crowded farms would benefit most from this change and the sales process would be easiest.
