With Heidi Waterhouse

  - Technical debt compounds in a way that is painful

## Localization
  - get them early, reference labels -> will make it so much easier
  later
  - no words in logos or images

## Distributon

## Security
  - use 3rd party people that do this
  - leave room for encryption
  - sunset your data after a certain period

## Extensibility
   - make your work modifiable

## Documentation
  - documentation helps us with onboarding and reduces context switches
  for seniors
  - production scripts and build sequences need to be recorded

## Affordance
  - tells us what we are doing without documentation

## Acceptance
  - have you showed this product to anyone who is like the user (not the
  financiers) -> need to actually talk to them
  - show them the product and don't tell them how it supposed to work is
  the hardest and most important part
  - "Making users awesome" - people don't want to be using software,
  they want to be drawing or taking a photograph, software is just an
  intermediary

## Accessiblity
  - look at this on a non-retina screen
  - emulators and physical are totally different experiences
  - 8% of men are red-green color blind
   - status updates for nagios use red-green, which isn't helpful
  - hide your mouse, use TAB instead
  - we are all temporarily able-bodied


## Tactics
  - Learn how to write ROI documents
  - diverse teams will help with these problems
  - money is the root of all business decisons
  - be productively lazy
