- [Quest to build the perfect team](https://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?_r=0)

## Reading Notes
  - decentralized control
  - manager surveys
    - different mediums to collect feedback
  - no exact patterns
  - rapport building -> chit chat, care about others as people as much
  as co-workers
    - social sensitivity
      - reading the [Reading the Mind in the Eyes test](http://socialintelligence.labinthewild.org/mite/)
    - trust
  - groups norms are stronger than the individual, even if the
  individual is strong, driven and accomplished
  - ?what is data of a strong group?
  - following up on hurtful interactions (saying the things that go
  unsaid)
  - Manager:
    - humility, my team is smarter than me -> vulnerability
    - fulfillment of creating a great team
    - setting communication norms
    - empathy norms and quick follow up
