## Polymorphism vs duck typing

  - from the gospel of [stackoverflow](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11502482/1496757) and [stackexchange](http://programmers.stackexchange.com/a/121781) and a [gist](https://gist.github.com/46bit/4366791)

  ### Polymorphism
    - often hear in the context of subclasses

  ### Duck typing
    - usually hear in the context of mixins
    - an interface that can interact without having to know what that object is

  - class inheritance versus interface inheritance


## Composition vs class inheritance
  - Rule of thumb: when behavior spans classes use composition and when limited to derivations of classes then use subclassing
  - 

## Run time versus compile time

## Program to an interface not an implementation
  - interface is the behavior
