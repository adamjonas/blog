I toed the line for months trying to code a little and be the manager I wanted to be. When the team was at 8 I could find time to block off a morning without meetings or distractions. I could be a hybrid. As we grew to 12 it became untenable. The code I contributed was copy and CSS changes. Barely anything that was worthwhile from a contribution perspective. Letting go was the healthiest thing I could do. I’m not a coder anymore and I admitted that to my team in a frank conversation about imposter syndrome a few weeks ago. I’m a conductor. My job is to make sure the symphony continues to play in harmony. To draw out the sounds and rhythms of my individuals through 1 on 1s, quarterlies and conversations in the hallways.

Being an effective hybrid is possible. We have one. He is a great individual contributor and without fail he does his 1 on 1s and still pushes a ton of code. It works and he is getting the reps he needs to be a future CTO. Taking him off the keyboard would make him miserable and so he’ll toe the line for a while. He has 5 reports and I’m wary to give him more.

I’ve heard coders talk about how bad managers are out of touch because they don’t build anything anymore. I agree, which scares me. Which is why I want to try an experiment. I went on a paternity leave in October for a full month. I totally unplugged and trusted my lieutenants to carry the load. It went fine. No fires. Nobody quit. No month long rabbit holes anyone fell into. There was some maintenance and fine tuning to be done upon my return and some of the project assignments were off, but overall things went well. Meaning that if I disappeared for another month things would likely be fine again. Meaning I could become a dev for a month and let my lieutenants run the show again. I think it would be hard for me to resist my natural inclination to push, nudge and otherwise direct how the team runs, but what might happen if I stop going to all the high level meetings? We’ll find out. I’m going to propose we try it next month.

To be the manager my people deserve for a team of certain size I needed to let go of my drive to code. Sure I can nibble on small projects, but my days of plugging in and zoning out are seemingly over. Hybrids can be of value, but if you are running the show and managing anything larger than a team of 7-8 then you are doing yourself and your team a disservice by trying to focus on anything but your people.
