promises make asych code more readable and bring back the value of a return value as opposed to calling nested callback functions.

[jquery isn't up to spec for promises](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/23951745/is-any-jquery-version-compliant-to-promise-a-specifications) but jquery 3.0 is.

Josh's prefered promise lib is [when.js](https://github.com/cujojs/when)

[Ajax patterns](http://ajaxpatterns.org/) is interesting reading.
