With Christian Heilmann

## Machines vs. Humans
  - machines don't get tired or make mistake as they fatigue
  - law is boring and machines don't get bored
  - The future of employement -> company secretaries
  - machines handle grunt work and humans handle human decisions -> the
  more abstract the less likely you are to be replaced by a computer
  - the more predictable we are as programmers, the more likely we are
  going to be replaced
  - AI software that makes AI software
  - past being factory workers and finding the way to add value
  - the saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers
  knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.
  - just making money isn't enough anymore
  - Orwell predicted cameras everyone but didn't predict we would buy the camera
  - "Technological progress has merely provided us with more efficient
  means for going backwards." -> Aldous Huxley
  - "the power of big data and psychographics"
  - inclusive design set that microsoft released
  - it's not about allowing access but avoiding barriers
  - spotlight - show me my documents larger than 20 pages
  - netflix -> fast movement can be compressed more than slow movement
  - Aipoly -> identify objects on the phone, not running on the internet
  - facebook open sourced identifying objects
  - AI lip reading for 46% accuracy, humans have 12% accuracy
  - imagenet and open images dataset -> image data sets, properly
  trained data sets to play with
  - `captionbot.ai`
