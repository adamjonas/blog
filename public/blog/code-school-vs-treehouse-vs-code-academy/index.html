<div class="entry-content"><p>Like any n00b, I spent a lot of time learning the skills of programming online. Outside of random YouTube Videos (<a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/thenewboston">NewBoston</a> is worth your time), there are three well-known online products&#8211; <a href="http://www.codeschool.com/">Code School</a>, <a href="http://teamtreehouse.com/">Treehouse</a>, and <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a>. I&#8217;d estimate, I&#8217;ve spent around 80 hours on these sites. I don&#8217;t know if that is a lot or a little, but I do know that Code School is the clear winner&#8230;</p>

<p><img class="left" src="/images/codeschool.jpeg" title="Code School" ></p>

<h3>Codecademy</h3>

<p>(not to be confused with <a href="http://www.builtinchicago.org/blog/code-academy-evolves-starter-league-and-partners-37signals">Code Academy</a>) <a href="http://www.businessinsider.com/codecademy-1000000-users-2012-1">exploded on the scene last fall</a>, but really falls short in the <a href="http://programmingzen.com/2012/01/16/on-the-usability-of-codecademy/">usability</a> department and error feedback. To be fair, I only have spent time with their JavaScript courses, but it&#8217;s hard to get past first impressions. Granted, Codecademy is run by a <a href="http://mashable.com/2012/07/25/zach-sims-codecademy/">couple of young&#8217;ins</a> and haven&#8217;t had the head start that Code School has on its interactive browser, but I found myself more than frustrated going through their lessons. If they spent less time, hammering my inbox with weekly emails and built a better interface, I&#8217;d be more likely to take a look at their newly updated and <a href="(http://www.crunchbase.com/company/codecademy">well funded site</a> (I&#8217;ve heard they added Ruby lessons). At least for now, Codecademy is FREE. So serious brownie points there.</p>

<p><strong>EDIT</strong>: I recently revisited <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/">Codecademy</a> and the usability (which is clearly my biggest gripe above) has really been refined and improved. In fact, I was impressed with the ease of use this go around&#8230; If I were starting from scratch I would start here, while Code School caters to an intermediate skill level and above.)</p>

<h3>Treehouse is&#8230;</h3>

<p>in a word, boring. Thankfully, I was able to guess most of the answers without struggling through the videos. I did spend, however, a portion of the time learning about subjects on the periphery. Their explanations of structs, I/O, and Ruby Core had slipped through the cracks of other beginner Ruby tutorials. I couldn&#8217;t get into the humor of <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jQNXtyoyHic">Mike the Frog</a> or some of their other movie &#8220;rewards,&#8221; but I guess that really shouldn&#8217;t be the main motivating factor. While others thought it is silly, I like that <a href="https://twitter.com/jseifer">Jason Seifer</a> is such a goofball. He is the lone source of humor in an overall dry learning experience. Personally, I learn faster by doing and Treehouse falls short here. Though they do sprinkle in a few interactive quizzes, it just isn&#8217;t enough. If you are going to financially invent in your learning, I&#8217;d save it for&#8230;</p>

<h3>Code School</h3>

<p><strong>rocks</strong>. It has clearly been the best use of my time. The videos are much more in-depth and the interactive browser is the superior to everything else I&#8217;ve seen. The <a href="http://envylabs.com/">Envy Labs Team</a> goes into significantly more detail than their aforementioned competitors. Their material is engaging, challenging, and well thought-out. What I enjoyed most (besides the information of course) is the self-depreciating humor that dots their casts. Cheesy graphics and dedication to a theme, for example Zombie terminology, finds the right balance of hilarious and non-interfering entertainment. When I first took their beginner courses, I grumbled at the level of detail they covered. Now that I picked up a few things, Code School does an amazing job of covering the entire breadth of subjects within a topic. Maybe most importantly, the error feedback is actually useful as are their hints. My sole criticism is that there is a recognizable difference between <a href="https://twitter.com/greggpollack">Gregg Pollack</a> and the others characters. If he could navigate the office politics, Gregg should do all the casts.</p>

<p>Now in my 7th month of my programming career, <a href="http://shitavisays.tumblr.com/">Avi&#8217;s words</a> have more meaning than ever:</p>

<blockquote><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not about learning the syntax. Anyone can learn that. Learning to program is learning how to communicate.&#8221; &#8211; Avi Flombaum</p></blockquote>

<p>If you are going to learn the syntax (which we DO need to do), Code School is very much worth it and <a href="http://paulstamatiou.com/code-school-learn-by-doing">I&#8217;m not the only one who thinks so</a>. But what do I know? Not that much. What do you think?</p>

<p>(Tip to <a href="https://twitter.com/davidbakertv">David Baker</a> for the subject.)</p>
