<p>“Computer science education cannot make anybody an expert programmer any more than studying brushes and pigment can make somebody an expert painter.”
- Eric S. Raymond</p>

<p>Good design adds value faster than it adds cost.
- Thomas C. Gale</p>

<p>Talk is cheap. Show me the code.
- Linus Torvalds</p>

<p>Perfection [in design] is achieved, not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away.
- Antoine de Saint-Exupéry</p>

<p>Debugging is twice as hard as writing the code in the first place. Therefore, if you write the code as cleverly as possible, you are, by definition, not smart enough to debug it.
- Brian W. Kernighan.</p>

<p>To iterate is human, to recurse divine.
- L. Peter Deutsch</p>

<p>Most good programmers do programming not because they expect to get paid or get adulation by the public, but because it is fun to program.
