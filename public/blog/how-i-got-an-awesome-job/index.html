<div class="entry-content"><h2>Code changed my life</h2>

<p>On Thursday, I was offered a job with <a href="http://carrotcreative.com/">Carrot Creative</a> in a <a href="https://github.com/ajonas04/carrotfun/pull/1">very original way</a>. I made the decision to learn how to program less than a year ago and code delivered me a mentor, an embracing community, and now, a new job.</p>

<h3>The beginnings</h3>

<p>I wrote my first line of code February of 2012 as a student in a <a href="http://www.skillshare.com/Become-a-Ruby-on-Rails-Developer-An-Intensive-5-Week-Course/962578898/250012953">Rails Skillshare class</a>. That first class was three hours focused exclusively on Rails. In the first ten minutes, I realized I was out of my depth. The teacher, <a href="https://twitter.com/aviflombaum">Avi Flombaum</a>, offered me two options: 1) I could have my money back or 2) I could continue to come back until I got it. I took his class three times.</p>

<h3>Tipping Point</h3>

<p>Inspired by guys like <a href="http://viniciusvacanti.com/2010/09/13/cant-find-a-technical-co-founder-do-it-yourself/">Vin Vacanti</a>, I knew that while it wasn&#8217;t going to be easy, I could do this. I had learned Spanish as an adult and I figured this wasn&#8217;t going to be much different. I started with the vocabulary; I wrote down the definitions of arrays, methods, blocks, hashes, arguments, accessors&#8230; Avi had to painstakingly explain all the concepts I didn&#8217;t understand, which was pretty much everything.</p>

<p>At that point, Codecademy was still very young and it wasn&#8217;t a great fit for me. Instead, I <a href="http://tryruby.org/levels/1/challenges/0">tried Ruby</a>, <a href="http://pine.fm/LearnToProgram/">learned to program</a>, leaned on <a href="http://ruby.railstutorial.org/">Michael Hartl</a>, and even resorted to the <a href="http://railsforzombies.org/">Living Dead</a>. While I learned a lot on my own, I knew it wasn&#8217;t really enough.</p>

<h3>Immersion</h3>

<p>With the summer rolling around, it was clear that in order to get to where I wanted to go I needed full-blown immersion. It just so happened that Avi was founding what eventually became the <a href="http://flatironschool.com/">The Flatiron School</a>, but back then it was called the Keyvoon Experiment. I could dedicate a lot of space to how awesome the program was, but you can just look at <a href="http://www.adamjonas.com/blog/archives">my archives</a>. I wrote down pretty much everything we covered.</p>

<h3>Get a hair cut and get a real job</h3>

<p>Since finishing the program last month, I have interviewed with more than a dozen companies. Getting interviews was easy; getting though them was humbling. I got a lot of CS questions, though I had never been introduced to a binary tree structure. Some were nice about it. Others were dismissive. In the end, it worked out. A <a href="https://hiremecarrot.herokuapp.com/">little extra-credit project</a> led to a <a href="https://github.com/ajonas04/carrotfun/pull/1">clever job offer</a>. I couldn&#8217;t be happier.</p>

<h3>WIP</h3>

<p>It takes a village to raise a coder in less than a year. Learning something entirely new can be demoralizing. I have to thank my beautiful fianc√© for the free passes to attend weekend classes and for her patience when I woke up to jot down that elusive solution which arrived during my R.E.M. cycle. I have to thank <a href="http://flatironschool.com/#people">The Flatiron School guys</a> for giving a shit.</p>

<p>Clearly, my education isn&#8217;t complete. That first day I didn&#8217;t know what a method was. Now, I don&#8217;t know what lots of things are. But just maybe I&#8217;ll make the aforementioned people proud by creating something to justify all the work that they put into me. No promises, but thanks to them, I at least have a chance.</p>
