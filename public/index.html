  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Intro</h2>

<p>&#8220;elastic search is full text sreach engine, non-relational DB, analytics engine&#8221;</p>

<ul>
<li>has clustering and managed over REST</li>
<li><p>Suggest Explicit mapping</p></li>
<li><p>keywords -> non-analyzed data</p></li>
<li><p>full text -> analyzed</p></li>
<li><p>filters -> will need <code>bool</code> then <code>filters</code></p></li>
</ul>


<h2>relevance -> score meta data field for document match</h2>

<ul>
<li>things are ranked</li>
<li>filters are faster and don&#8217;t have relevance (so if you don&#8217;t care, go with fiters)</li>
<li>can boost relevance</li>
</ul>


<h2>multi-index multi-type</h2>

<ul>
<li>lots of power</li>
</ul>


<h2>Aggregation -> group by on steroids</h2>

<ul>
<li>SQL: group by the bucket</li>
<li>aggregator -> can do nested group by and data retrieval</li>
</ul>


<h2>Managing elastic search</h2>

<ul>
<li>clustering

<ul>
<li>odd number of nodes bigger than 1

<ul>
<li>3 shards and replication</li>
<li>a third node can shuffle the shards and the replicas</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>ELK Stack</h2>

<ul>
<li>elastic search, logstash, and kubana</li>
<li>logstash

<ul>
<li>want to parse and stash log data</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>kubana

<ul>
<li>front end visualizer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>now beats added -> lightweight, written in go -> for shipping</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Why machine learning - you can predict the future</h2>

<ul>
<li>Explosion of data, more available than ever</li>
<li>sheer processing power available at a reasonable price point</li>
</ul>


<h2>Data Preparation Tools</h2>

<ul>
<li>Rstudio -> data prep and execute the machine learning</li>
<li>jupyter notebooks -> python in the cloud</li>
<li>excel -> stick with the tools you know</li>
<li>azure machine learning studio</li>
<li>scikit learn (competitor to r studio) for python</li>
<li>relational database tools (SQL queries)</li>
<li>sed / awk</li>
<li>python, r, sql most common languages to clean up data</li>
</ul>


<h2>Data Cleaning</h2>

<ul>
<li>missing values in data or repeating values in data (blanks, null,
n/a, unknown, 999999)</li>
<li>what&#8217;s your business goal?

<ul>
<li>SPCA - can you help us predict what animals won&#8217;t get adopted?</li>
<li>got enough data to be significant, you can delete rows -> not
always an option</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>can substitute a specific value (can go with a worst case
scenario)</li>
<li>fill forward and fill backwards based on the last value we read ->
going to have to write code</li>
<li>R is.na()</li>
<li><p>python pandas.fillna(), pandas.isnull()</p></li>
<li><p>excel tips -></p>

<ul>
<li>select individual columns, go to special, select blanks (will
select every blank cell) and you can enter a value</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>repeated values</p>

<ul>
<li>causes a bias in the data</li>
<li>duplicate row vs duplicate IDs</li>
<li>r duplicated()</li>
<li>python dataframe.drop_duplicates</li>
<li>SQL DISTINCT or correctlated queries</li>
<li>correlated subquery -> if the rows are the same but the IDs are different when you find
two identitical records and delete the one with the lower ID
number</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Data Transformation</h2>

<ul>
<li>Decomposition

<ul>
<li>the more you know about the data, the better</li>
<li>one column represents two or more values (like addresses lumped
together and finding the city and state)</li>
<li>return a 1 or 0 to represented spayed and nuetered</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Aggregation</p>

<ul>
<li>how many copies of different books to keep in stock?</li>
<li>don&#8217;t want the day it was sold, want total number of books sold
per wk/mon x date</li>
<li>select count(*) from sales group by (books sold per period)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Scaling</p>

<ul>
<li>predict how long a patient admitted the flu will need to stay in
the hospital</li>
<li>because the age has a wider varience in age you don&#8217;t see the
lower differences like temperatute

<ul>
<li>create ranges -> normalizing, standardizing</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Concolusion</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Training data versus test data</p>

<ul>
<li>subject matter experts become important as they need to undetr</li>
<li>tumors -> which do you want, one with more false positives and one
with more false negatives</li>
</ul>

<h2>Machines vs. Humans</h2>

<ul>
<li>machines don&#8217;t get tired or make mistake as they fatigue</li>
<li>law is boring and machines don&#8217;t get bored</li>
<li>The future of employement -> company secretaries</li>
<li>machines handle grunt work and humans handle human decisions -> the
more abstract the less likely you are to be replaced by a computer</li>
<li>the more predictable we are as programmers, the more likely we are
going to be replaced</li>
<li>AI software that makes AI software</li>
<li>past being factory workers and finding the way to add value</li>
<li>the saddest aspect of life right now is that science gathers
knowledge faster than society gathers wisdom.</li>
<li>just making money isn&#8217;t enough anymore</li>
<li>Orwell predicted cameras everyone but didn&#8217;t predict we would buy the camera</li>
<li>&#8220;Technological progress has merely provided us with more efficient
means for going backwards.&#8221; -> Aldous Huxley</li>
<li>&#8220;the power of big data and psychographics&#8221;</li>
<li>inclusive design set that microsoft released</li>
<li>it&#8217;s not about allowing access but avoiding barriers</li>
<li>spotlight - show me my documents larger than 20 pages</li>
<li>netflix -> fast movement can be compressed more than slow movement</li>
<li>Aipoly -> identify objects on the phone, not running on the internet</li>
<li>facebook open sourced identifying objects</li>
<li>AI lip reading for 46% accuracy, humans have 12% accuracy</li>
<li>imagenet and open images dataset -> image data sets, properly
trained data sets to play with</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>With Maarten Balliauw</p>

<ul>
<li>people know should more about DNS and the http level</li>
</ul>


<h2>DNS 101</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>How the internet works</p>

<ul>
<li>IPv4 or IPv6</li>
<li>Check own operating system files to see if the host file has a
record is known</li>
<li>will check the DNS cache for the local machine</li>
<li>OS will ask the router and check its own host file and DNS cache</li>
<li>same process for the ISP</li>
<li>the ISP will then go to the root server, address of the
authoritative server</li>
<li><p>6 hubs look ups</p></li>
<li><p><code>nslookup google.com</code></p></li>
<li><p><code>dig A google.com +trace</code></p></li>
<li><p>two types of servers</p>

<ul>
<li>authorative (owns the domain)</li>
<li>cache (recursor) -> resolves the domain for you</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>DNS protcol designed in 1983

<ul>
<li>designed to map a domain name to an IP address</li>
<li>added TXT records and IPv6</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TLD managed by separate organizatons (verisign, canadian internet
registrartion authority)

<ul>
<li>all make their own rules e.g. need to be a canadian to be a .ca
domain name, transfer rules</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>hierarchical system:

<ul>
<li>hit <code>.</code> first</li>
<li>then TLD like <code>org, com, ca</code></li>
<li>can also create maps within a specific domain and could create
own hierarchy like google does</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>caches

<ul>
<li>TTL -</li>
<li>cannot clear cache at ISP</li>
<li>keep the old IP address to maintain both</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>DNS zones</p>

<ul>
<li>UDP protocol</li>
<li>only 13 root servers across the world</li>
<li><code>root-servers.org</code></li>
<li>$100k/yr to get own TLD</li>
<li><p>? where does the money for those fees go for buying a TLD?</p></li>
<li><p>a text file and are hierarchical</p></li>
<li>SOA -> start of authority</li>
<li><p>Name of authoritive master name server (NA)</p></li>
<li><p>CNAME - redirect at the DNS record</p></li>
<li>MX - find mail server at specific address</li>
<li>TXT - validate domain ownership/spam rules</li>
<li>SRV - descibes a service type and port (like for in network
printer)</li>
<li><p>PTR - reverse DNS</p></li>
<li><p>zone transfers</p>

<ul>
<li>most IPs require more than 1 nameserver</li>
<li>master name server and that will sync with slave nameservers</li>
<li>no authentication and may expose internal services</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Security</h2>

<ul>
<li>old protocol</li>
<li>cache poisoning</li>
<li>DNSSEC - checks the origin - certificate chain</li>
<li><p>most modern browsers are checking for DNSSEC records</p></li>
<li><p>DDoS</p>

<ul>
<li>lots of open resolvers out there</li>
<li>DNS amplication for DDos</li>
<li>disable recursion</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>DNS in application archtecture</h2>

<ul>
<li>DNS failover and load balancing</li>
<li>add multiple DNS records -> will be a poor man&#8217;s load balancer
because it will return an random record</li>
<li>intelligence DNS server (CNS)</li>
<li>configuration in DNS

<ul>
<li>use DNS as a configuration store</li>
<li>DNS record could point to a TXT value</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>service discovery</li>
</ul>


<h2>DNS for fun and profit</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>Abusing DNS</p>

<ul>
<li>public hotspots</li>
<li>proxy server translating HTTP</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>iodine - same HTTP over DNS - tunnel traffic</p>

<ul>
<li><code>code.kryo.se/iodine</code></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h3>ACID -></h3>

<ul>
<li>atomicity: all or nothing. If one of 3 writes fails it rolls it back</li>
<li>Consistency:</li>
<li>Isolation:</li>
<li><p>Durability: DB survives</p></li>
<li><p>no-sql aren&#8217;t faster because of algorithms, they are faster because they did it because they did away with the guarantees</p></li>
</ul>


<p>google spanner - reliable network because it&#8217;s with in their own fiber optics</p>

<h3>SQL is declarative language</h3>

<ul>
<li>don&#8217;t give the computer exact instructions. Giving the comp a rough outline and the DB.</li>
</ul>


<h3>index is a tree</h3>

<ul>
<li>binary tree</li>
<li>doubled the size of the tree but only increased by 33%  - O(log n)</li>
<li>balanced tree -> rebalancing in order to make it as fast as possible</li>
<li>why not add indexes to everything

<ul>
<li>disk space and inserts</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Quick sort</h3>

<ul>
<li>fastest, but not that fast for records on disk</li>
</ul>


<h3>Merge sort</h3>

<ul>
<li>divide and conquor algorithm</li>
<li>O(n log n)</li>
</ul>


<h3>Joins:</h3>

<ul>
<li>nested loop JOINs - O(n<sup>2)</sup></li>
</ul>


<h3>Hash Join -> O(n)</h3>

<ul>
<li>Hash tables -> values are pointers because they are in linked lists

<ul>
<li>building the hash table from the beginning is expensive.</li>
<li>MD5? go with a bit key that doesn&#8217;t guarantee no collisions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>good for lots of duplicates</li>
</ul>


<h3>Merge Join -> O(m log n)</h3>

<ul>
<li>lists are already sorted.</li>
</ul>


<h3>Query plans</h3>

<ul>
<li>explain or explain analyze -> can tune the query to be faster</li>
</ul>


<h3>natural selection process for finding the best query plan</h3>

<ul>
<li>like genetic selection</li>
<li>doing all this in milliseconds</li>
<li>Evaluation -> selection -> crossover -> mutation</li>
</ul>


<h3>Caching</h3>

<ul>
<li>cache warmup period</li>
<li>Least recently used (LRU) in memory cache</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>When I told my mother, an executive of 30 years mostly spent at <a href="http://www.crabtree-evelyn.com/">Crabtree and Evelyn</a>, about my goal to make myself obsolete she flipped.</p>

<p>&#8220;You are working yourself out of your job,&#8221; she warned. &#8220;You need to be doing the opposite.&#8221;</p>

<p>My mom fought through sexism for decades to maintain her influential role at the top of the hierarchy. My mother is a scrapper and she clearly had to defend her territory. From her advice on management issues however, it seems pretty clear to me she probably never got ahead of the tsunami of work that consumes managers’ everyday lives. I mostly observe managers fire fighting and doing implementation. This is a trap. We all want to feel important, but if managers are the single point of failure, things will fall apart.</p>

<p>I’ve mused about my take on <a href="/blog/my-take-on-maker-versus-manager/">maker versus manager</a>, it can be hard to let go, but those that never let go of the hybrid role are doomed. The manager may not be, but the team is. We owe it to our reports to make sure we have the time to properly manage them. It feeds our egos to have a full calendar and lots of “important” decisions to make, but if that’s all we do then we will eventually drown in our own self-importance rather than develop the people on our team to help shoulder the load. Scale will break us.</p>

<p>So thanks mom for the advice, but I still strive to make myself obsolete, so the world will continue to spin without me. So I can go on vacation without stressing. So I can dedicate a good chunk of my week to 1 on 1s and so my lieutenants feel qualified and empowered to make the calls shape our team and product. I may be working myself out of a job, but at least I feel like I’m going to do this one right.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>What is the price worth paying to introduce a new technology into the stack? For our heavily junior team of 13 the price feels high. Our JS weapon of choice has been backbone and marionette. This toolset wasn’t determined by me. It was molded and implemented by a talented dev who might be a little short on leadership experience but has talent and intuition in spades. We’ve made some mistakes along the way, but the architectural choices he has made have served us well. Still about 8 months since its we push our first major feature set with marionette, the entire team has yet to be completely onboarded. We may be getting to the size where we can split our squad into front-end and back-end specialists, but to date that has never been discussed as a group. The fact that we all haven’t got there is a problem. It means that some of us aren’t capable to work on parts of the stack, which affects feature assignments and pairing.</p>

<p>This same dev is now suggesting that we introduce React to one aspect of the stack because of its rising popularity in the community. Our team spends a lot of time focusing on happiness at an individual level with 1 on 1s and <a href="/blog/quarterlies/">quarterlies</a>, but my priority isn’t individual happiness but rather team morale. At the moment, team morale is at an all-time high. Will introducing a new barrier to entry positively affect team morale because of its shiney? Will allowing the two JS leads on the team play with a new toy positively affect team morale? They both claimed in their last quarterly that their work brought them high levels of meaning and purpose and they found it challenging enough.</p>

<p>It is a tough call. I don’t have enough knowledge to know if this is truly a better tool or something new to learn for the sake of something new. How will we go about leveling up newcomers on two JS systems?</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I heard you, goals are important. I get it. I&#8217;ve watched the Ted talks and read the zillionth article on the importance of goals. I understand the psychology and the physiology. I’ve got a dirty secret though. I haven’t been able to set goals for developers. We’ve tried KPIs and they don’t seem to filter down to the individual contributor level. When I ran our apprenticeship program two years ago I tried weekly goals, bi-weekly goals, monthly goals and quarterly goals. The problem was, the constants, the areas the goals could be clearly defined were mostly areas of personal development &#8211; writing blog posts, learning keyboard shortcuts, giving a lunch and learn, etc. I had a much harder time defining goals for them to improve in their core job function, namely contributing well built features and pushing good code.</p>

<p>Recently we took a shot at changing our criteria for hiring and job responsibilities to being value based rather than bring task or milestone based. This rubric broke down our company values into behaviors and defined the expectations for each level within engineering. The resulting document sat well with the team and I think we are gettng closer, but I still can’t help but feel unfortable about the subjectivity of how to define a good productive dev. What devs do is complicated, which makes promotions and evaluation complicated. I don’t care whether you wrote a blog post this week if you pushed a great feature. I do care that you helped someone else push their feature or jumped in on a tough bug when everyone pretended they didn&#8217;t see it. But how do I formulate concrete actionable goals around that? Anything I come up with feels so arbitrary.</p>

<p>When we tried KPIs for the engineering team it made sense to have goals around the product. But for individual contributors who didn’t have a choice about what feature they build or how the product evolves from a high level, I could connect them to the department goal in a meta way, but not on an individual basis. How could they be held responsible for the adoption success a feature set, for example, that they didn’t have much agency in designing or implementing?</p>

<p>The best I can do for goal setting is to pull out actionable points from our <a href="/blog/quarterlies/">longer-arching conversations</a> and hold them accountable on the things that matter to them both. It feels like there has to be something better, but I haven&#8217;t been smart enough to figure it out.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Weekly 1 on 1s are not enough. Maybe if I did them better they would be, but mine are all on Fridays and often I’m not able to tease out anything more than the day to day updates and feelings of the past week. That’s not to say that I’m going to stop, 1 on 1s keep me connected to my reports and even if 1 out of every 5 is a breakthrough session then it is time very well spent.</p>

<p>The problem that I see in 1 on 1s as I run them is that it is hard to focus on the longer arching themes on a weekly basis. For whatever reason, it feels awkward to ask about career goals, work fulfillment, etc. with such regularity. Enter the quarterly. I’ve just completed my fourth attempt of quarterlies (not including the annual review). I’m happy with the conversations and the depth of the issues we discuss in those session but my attempt at this didn’t start very well.</p>

<p>Here were the set of questions from the first quarterly survey which I conducted using google forms:</p>

<ul>
<li>How happy are you in labs?</li>
<li>I feel like I&#8217;m growing my skills</li>
<li>I get clear and frequent feedback about my performance?</li>
<li>Given the products we are building, what types of things do you want to work on?</li>
<li>What skills (on or off the keyboard) do you want to improve that you don&#8217;t see an opportunity to do in your current role?</li>
<li>I understand why we are building Learn and the related apps</li>
<li>If you answer that you get it, please summarize why we are putting so much work into Learn.</li>
<li>If you answered you don&#8217;t get it, please tell me what needs further explanation.</li>
<li>Anything else you want to discuss?</li>
<li>What is one thing that would make you happier or more productive?</li>
</ul>


<p>This caused a lot of anxiety. Why am I doing this? What was I going to use this information for? Many of those first conversations were stilted, even confrontational. Someone actually took this time to give his two week notice. It wasn’t pretty. Even so, I was able to battle through these difficult conversations and pull out a lot of agenda topics that we were able to resolve as a group. This made it all worthwhile. Gathering the team in the room to talk about issues that were affecting all of us and re-focus our direction was incredibly fruitful. I also followed up with the individuals that took issue with the set of questions I was asking and had them help me craft a questionnaire that was easier for them to swallow.</p>

<p>Three month later the process went much smoother. Here were the revised questions.</p>

<ul>
<li>I feel like I&#8217;m growing my skills</li>
<li>What is one thing that would make you happier or more productive?</li>
<li>In what ways would you like to grow your skills? What kind of support will you need?</li>
<li>Do you feel like you’re getting enough clear feedback?</li>
<li>How do you feel about the Lab&#8217;s processes in general?</li>
<li>Given the products we are building, what types of things do you want to work on?</li>
<li>I find the work that I do full of meaning and purpose</li>
<li>I am proud of the work that I do for my team</li>
<li>The work that I do is challenging</li>
<li>How would you rate yourself in the following 4 tenets of our “shipping culture” (circle one for each category):</li>
<li>Velocity</li>
<li>Quality</li>
<li>Ownership</li>
<li>Communication</li>
</ul>


<p>This one clicked much better. I got great responses and we had a great team discussion. Processes changed, people were engaged and excited to debate with each other. I was able to present the group with statistics on aggregated stats on how challenged individuals felt and where we needed to improve as a group.</p>

<p>A year later, this is the best thing I think I do as a manager. We ask similar long form answers but have dropped the ratings of the department values in lieu of the company values (see future post on Value Based Assessments). With a young team, it isn’t uncommon for me to see career aspirations change quarter along with engagement and performance. I’ve found these quarterlies to be better discussions than the annual review. Some reasons might be, it isn’t as formal or mired in the connotations of a scary end of year process. I use google forms rather than some HR software, which seems pretty natural and lightweight for devs. I choose a venue that seems more informal but is still off-site (recently I’ve been camping out at Au Bon Pain). And yet, much of this conversation is spent on discussing performance, areas of improvement, how to grow, resetting expectations and ways to improve the team and product &#8211; all the things that I would imagine a good annual review process is supposed to do. This cycle I’ve scheduled 90 minutes for each session but not one actually was completed in time. People are talking for 2 to 2 ½ hour stretches even though it is basically the same set of questions that I’ve used for the last three rounds. This is a huge investment of time. All said and done I will have done more than 30 hours of quarterlies before preparing a deck we can discuss as a group. But this is working and the conversations have improved every quarter.</p>

<p>Even with its rocky start, quarterlies have served us well. I would have never known many of the team’s process pain points without these conversations and it has saved me when performance slips so that I can get on the record to address it quickly. If annual reviews are broken my first guess would be that even if they are conducted well, they are just too infrequent. Things on my team move too quickly to address on a 12-month cycle. This is my best shot at making it better.</p>
